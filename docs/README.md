# AetherAI Documentation
**Adaptive intelligence for every device.**

Welcome to the official documentation for **AetherAI**, an open‑source universal AI runtime designed to work on *any* device, with *any* model, under *any* conditions.

AetherAI intelligently detects your hardware, storage, and connectivity, then automatically selects the best available AI model — local or cloud — to deliver a seamless, consistent experience. Whether you're offline on a low‑power machine or online with access to powerful cloud models, AetherAI adapts to your environment.

This documentation will guide you through installation, architecture, components, development, and contribution.

## 🚀 What Is AetherAI?

AetherAI is not a single model — it’s a **runtime layer** that:

- Runs local models when offline  
- Uses cloud models when online  
- Upgrades itself when resources allow  
- Falls back gracefully when conditions change  
- Provides a unified API for developers  
- Works across platforms and hardware configurations  

AetherAI’s goal is to make AI **portable, adaptive, and accessible**.

## 🌟 Project Vision

AetherAI aims to become the standard open‑source AI runtime — a flexible, intelligent layer that lets developers build once and run anywhere, without worrying about models, hardware, or connectivity.

If you believe AI should be adaptive, open, and universally accessible, you’re in the right place.
